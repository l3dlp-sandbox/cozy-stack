# Sharing

The owner of a cozy instance can share access to her documents to other users.

## Sharing by links

A client-side application can propose sharing by links:

1. The application must have a public route in its manifest. See
   [Apps documentation](apps.md#routes) for how to do that.
2. The application can create a set of permissions for the shared documents,
   with codes. Another code called `shortcode` is also generated and associated
   with the code. This `shortcode` is much smaller (but secure), which is
   easier to be shared. See [permissions documentation](permissions.md) for the
   details.
3. The application can then create a shareable link (e.g.
   `https://calendar.cozy.example.net/public?sharecode=eiJ3iepoaihohz1Y`) by
   putting together the app sub-domain, the public route path, and a code for
   the permissions set.
4. The app can then send this link by mail, via the [jobs system](jobs.md), or
   just give it to the user, so he can transmit it to her friends via chat or
   other ways.

When someone opens the shared link, the stack will load the public route, find
the corresponding `index.html` file, and replace `{{.Token}}` inside it by a
token with the same set of permissions that `sharecode` offers. This token can
then be used as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header for requests to
the stack (or via cozy-client-js).

NB: The `shortcode` can also be used as the `Bearer`. In this case, the
corresponding `sharecode` will be matched on server-side

If necessary, the application can list the permissions for the token by calling
`/permissions/self` with this token.

## Cozy to cozy sharing

The owner of a cozy instance can send and synchronize documents to others cozy
users.

### Intents

When a sharing is authorized, the user is redirected to their cozy on the
application that was used for the sharing (when possible). It's possible to use
a specific route to do so, via the intents. The application must declare an
intent in its manifest for the action `SHARING`. The doctype of the intent must
be the same as the doctype of the first rule of the sharing. In the redirect
URL, the query string will have a `sharing` parameter with the sharing ID (but
no intent parameter).

### Routes

#### POST /sharings/

Create a new sharing. The sharing rules and recipients must be specified. The
`description`, `preview_path`, and `open_sharing` fields are optional. The
`app_slug` field is optional and is the slug of the web app by default.

[See the doc on io.cozy.sharings for in-depth explanation of all attributes](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-doctypes/docs/io.cozy.sharings/).

To create a sharing, no permissions on `io.cozy.sharings` are needed: an
application can create a sharing on the documents for whose it has a permission.

### GET /sharings/:sharing-id/discovery

If no preview_path is set, it's an URL to this route that will be sent to the
users to notify them that someone wants to share something with them. On this
page, they can fill the URL of their Cozy (if the user has already filled its
Cozy URL in a previous sharing, the form will be pre-filled and the user will
just have to click OK).

#### Query-String

| Parameter | Description                                                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| state     | a code that identify the recipient                                                        |
| shortcut  | true means that accepting the sharing will just create a shortcut on the recipient's Cozy |

#### Example

```http
GET /sharings/ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722/discovery?state=eiJ3iepoaihohz1Y&shortcut=true HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.net
```

### POST /sharings/:sharing-id/discovery

Give to the cozy of the sharer the URL of the Cozy of one recipient. The sharer
will register its-self as an OAuth client on the recipient cozy, and then will
ask the recipient to accept the permissions on its instance.

This route exists in two versions, the version is selected by the HTTP header
`Accept`

#### Classical (`x-www-form-urlencoded`)

| Parameter | Description                                                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| state     | a code that identify the recipient                                                        |
| url       | the URL of the Cozy for the recipient                                                     |
| shortcut  | true means that accepting the sharing will just create a shortcut on the recipient's Cozy |

##### Example

```http
POST /sharings/ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722/discovery HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.org
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: text/html

state=eiJ3iepoaihohz1Y&url=https://bob.example.net/
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Location: https://bob.example.net/auth/sharing?...
```

#### JSON

This version can be more convenient for applications that implement the preview
page. To do that, an application must give a `preview_path` when creating the
sharing. This path must be a public route of this application. The recipients
will receive a link to the application subdomain, on this page, and with a
`sharecode` in the query string (like for a share by link).

To know the `sharing-id`, it's possible to ask `GET /permissions/self`, with the
`sharecode` in the `Authorization` header (it's a JWT token). In the response,
the `source_id` field will be `io.cozy.sharings/<sharing-id>`.

##### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| sharecode | a code that identify the recipient    |
| url       | the URL of the Cozy for the recipient |

##### Example

```http
POST /sharings/ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722/discovery HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.org
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: application/json

sharecode=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJhcHAiLCJpYXQiOjE1MjAzNDM4NTc&url=https://bob.example.net/
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "redirect": "https://bob.example.net/auth/sharing?..."
}
```

### POST /sharings/:sharing-id/preview-url

This internal route can be used by the stack to get the URL where a member can
preview the sharing.

#### Request

```http
POST /sharings/ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722/discovery-url HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.net
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{

}
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "url": "https://drive.alice.example.net/preview?sharecode=..."
}
```

### GET /sharings/:sharing-id

Get the information about a sharing. This includes the content of the rules, the
members, as well as the already shared documents for this sharing.

For a member, we can have the following fields:

- a contact name (`name`), that is the name of this user as it appears in its
  contact document (if there is one such document)
- a public name (`public_name`), that is the name this user has put on his
  cozy as a public name (it is used for sending emails for example)
- an email addresse (`email`)
- an instance URL (`instance`)
- and a status (`status`).

**Notes:**

- the first member is always the sharer
- to display the list of members to a user, the `name` should be use if
  available, and if it is not the case, you can use the `public_name` or the
  `email`
- on a recipient, the only member with an `instance` is the local user.

### GET /sharings/news

It returns the number of shortcuts to a sharing that have not been seen.

#### Request

GET /sharings/news HTTP/1.1

```

#### Response

```http

Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
```

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "count": 5
  }
}
```

### GET /sharings/doctype/:doctype

Get information about all the sharings that have a rule for the given doctype.
This includes the content of the rules, the members, as well as the already
shared documents for this sharing.
A `shared_docs` query parameter is supported to control whether or not the
shared docs should be included in the response. Default is true.
This can be costful in case of large sharings, so it can be a good idea to set
it to false for performances.

### PUT /sharings/:sharing-id

The sharer's cozy sends a request to this route on the recipient's cozy to
create a sharing request, with information about the sharing. This request can
be used for two scenarios:

1. This request will be displayed to the recipient just before its final
   acceptation of the sharing, to be sure they know what will be shared.
2. This request will be used to create a shortcut (in that case, a query-string
   parameter `shortcut=true&url=...` will be added).

### GET /sharings/:sharing-id/recipients/:index/avatar

This route can be used to get an image that shows the avatar of a member of
this sharing. No permission is required to use this route, you just need to
know the sharing-id to use it. If no image has been chosen, a fallback will be
used, depending of the `fallback` parameter in the query-string:

- `initials`: a generated image with the initials of the owner's public name. This is the default behavior.
- `404`: just a 404 - Not found error.

If the `initials` fallback is used and the member has not yet seen the sharing,
the background of the image will be grey.

**Note**: 0 for the index means the sharer.

### POST /sharings/:sharing-id/\_bulk_docs

This endpoint is used by the sharing replicator of the stack to send documents
in a bulk to the other cozy. It is inspired by
http://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/bulk-api.html#db-bulk-docs.

**Note**: we force `new_edits` to `false`.

### GET /sharings/:sharing-id/io.cozy.files/:file-id

This is an internal endpoint used by a stack to get information about a folder.
It is used when a cozy sent to another cozy a file or folder inside a folder
that was trashed (and trash was emptied): the recipient does no longer have
information about the parent directory. To resolve the conflict, it recreates
the missing parent directory by asking the other cozy informations about it.

#### Request

```http
GET /sharings/ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722/io.cozy.files/6d245d072be5522bd3a6f273dd000c65 HTTP/1.1

Authorization: Bearer ...
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```

### PUT /sharings/:sharing-id/io.cozy.files/:file-id/metadata

This is an internal endpoint used by a stack to send the new metadata about a
file that has changed.

#### Request

```http
PUT /sharings/ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722/io.cozy.files/0c1116b028c6ae6f5cdafb949c088265/metadata HTTP/1.1

  }
}
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

Else, the content will need to be uploaded:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "key": "dcd478c6-46cf-11e8-9c3f-535468cbce7b"

initial sync is finished.

```http
DELETE /sharings/ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722/initial HTTP/1.1
Host: bob.example.net

## Real-time via websockets

You can subscribe to the [realtime](realtime.md) API for the normal doctypes,
but also for a special `io.cozy.sharings.initial_sync` doctype. For this
doctype, you can give the id of a sharing and you will be notified when a file
will be received during the initial synchronisation (`UPDATED`), and when the
sync will be done (`DELETED`).

### Example

```
client > {"method": "AUTH",
          "payload": "xxAppOrAuthTokenxx="}
client > {"method": "SUBSCRIBE",
          "payload": {"type": "io.cozy.sharings.initial_sync", "id": "ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722"}}
server > {"event": "UPDATED",
          "payload": {"id": "ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722", "type": "io.cozy.sharings.initial_sync", "doc": {"count": 12}}}
server > {"event": "UPDATED",
          "payload": {"id": "ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722", "type": "io.cozy.sharings.initial_sync", "doc": {"count": 13}}}
server > {"event": "DELETED",
          "payload": {"id": "ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722", "type": "io.cozy.sharings.initial_sync"}}
